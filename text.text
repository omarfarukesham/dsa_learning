hello i am use ing this terminal
Life is always hard, and unpredicatable, we don't know what will be happening tomorrow, we hava only control our present work actions
if the present work is hardest one, assume tomorrow world will be relatively easy. 
In this Advance Dice Game, only 14 steps, but it took me more than 21 days to solve those problem, it's not the JS write code issue,
rather understanding the critical problems.
